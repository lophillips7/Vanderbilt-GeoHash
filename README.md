# Vanderbilt-GeoHash
This is a public problem from Vanderbilt located here: https://github.com/juleswhite/cs5278-geohash-1

All files here are taken from the above github. The only file that has been modified is GeoHash.java which contains the main problem. 

# For loop or recursion
This code uses Java For Loops to solve the problem. It is stated in the original code provided by Jules White that recurssion is an added challenge. However, one can quickly realize that a recurssion approach is less efficient and practical.
If completed, I will add the recurssion solution.
